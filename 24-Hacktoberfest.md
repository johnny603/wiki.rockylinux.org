## Overview:
Hacktoberfest is DigitalOceanâ€™s annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October.\
Rockylinux has been involved by hosting a simple open-source project for anyone to contribute!\

## Highlights
  1. Johnny Santamaria made a post on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnnyds_i-got-the-hacktoberfest-2024-registered-activity-7250296534712385536-t9u9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) about this event
  2. Tools used: Github and Markdown
  3. I learned how to add files to contribute to projects
  4. I can apply this learning to team projects so everyone is on the same page

Workflow to contribute
  1. Check out the [discord](https://discord.gg/hacktoberfest)\
     Note that there are still open source projects to look at after October which you can do for fun
  3. Look at the project-sharing channel
  4. Open a repo
  5. Open issue on repo
  6. Star repo
  7. Fork repo
  8. Clone repo
  9. Read on the issue


## Outcome
I think this is a wonderful event to get people into open-source, no matter what skill set they have.\ 
I believe this is important since they promote innovation, accessibility, and community involvement, making open-source projects a critical part of the modern software ecosystem.\
It is also an easy way to make an impact digitally!
