# GUADEC (formerly GNOME Users and Developers European Conference)

## Event Details
- **Date:** July 19-24, 2024
- **Location:** Denver, CO, USA
- **Type:** Lanyard Sponsor
## Overview
According to the event description, "GUADEC is the GNOME community’s largest conference, bringing together hundreds of users, contributors, community members, and enthusiastic supporters for a week of talks and workshops."  The Rocky Linux community was delighted to sponsor this event and support the project, given that GNOME is the user interface that comes packaged with our operating system by default.  

## Highlights
- A construction worker walked into a bar carrying two pieces of asphalt. He said to the bartender, "I'll take two drinks please—one for me, and one for the road." Community Team Lead Krista Burdine [told a few bad construction jokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9mpdQIsmdE) and spoke about "Before they can come, you have to build it: making your project accessible to new contributors."
- As our first official connection with the GNOME community, we had a little introducing to do. A little charcuterie and drinks at a local eatery served as a great connecting point. Krista had the chance to attend a Diverse Women in Tech type after-hours dinner, and really enjoyed conversing with women of similar experience and interests.
- This was the first time Ryan Sipes has talked publicly about [the rebirth of Thunderbird](https://youtu.be/pWw1A1aKfh8?feature=shared), since he and his team figured out how to engage the community to contribute to their continued existence. Truly one of the most inspiring keynotes that could have been presented in an open source community. It lit a fire for us to engage our community with the same enthusiasm. 

## Outcome
This was the first time in a few years that the GNOME community had a meetup in the US, and we were pleased to be part of it. The purpose of the GNOME Foundation is to empower people with the technical tools to manage their personal computing experience. Our Community Team Lead contributed to that effort by speaking about making community accessible to new users.
