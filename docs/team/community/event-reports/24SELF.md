## Overview
What is the SouthEast LinuxFest (SELF)?

The SouthEast LinuxFest is a community event for anyone who wants to learn more about Linux and Open Source Software. It is part educational conference and part social gathering. Like Linux itself, it is shared with attendees of all skill levels to communicate tips and ideas, and to benefit all who use Linux and Open Source Software.  SELF is the place to learn, to make new friends, to network with new business partners, and most importantly, to have fun!   The most similar events to SELF are Linuxfest Northwest, Southern California Linux Expo, Penguicon, and Ohio Linuxfest.

What makes SELF unique?

While SELF is centered on Linux and Open Source, both desktop and enterprise, we are happy to explore related geeky areas.   We reliably have content on networking, programming, hardware, information security, amateur (“ham”) radio, and similar areas.   We also have a /dev/random track, which has proven very popular, where all bets are off in terms of content.  We’ve had everything from the Ukraine War to hardware computers used in WWI era battleships and their use in the Battle of Jutland to home automation.   Talks on these subjects are all day Friday, all day Saturday, and Sunday until after early afternoon.

Rocky Linux is a Silver Sponsor of the event
