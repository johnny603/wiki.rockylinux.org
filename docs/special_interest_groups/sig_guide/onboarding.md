!!! note
    Each Special Interest Group's onboarding should generally follow the guide below, however the specific implementation is left up to the SIG. Be sure to read the documentation for a the SIG you wish to join or, if in doubt, ask for help!


# SIG Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the Special Interest Groups (SIGs) here at Rocky Linux! This guide is crafted to help new members navigate through the onboarding process smoothly and efficiently. Joining a SIG allows you to contribute to the Rocky Linux ecosystem in a focused area, whether it involves Cloud, Containers, HPC, or any other special-interest area. 

## Step 1: Create a Rocky Account Services Account

Your journey begins with creating a Rocky Account Services (RAS) account, which grants you access to various Rocky Linux services and tools.

1. Navigate to [accounts.rockylinux.org](https://accounts.rockylinux.org) in your web browser.
2. Click on the "Register" button to start the account creation process.
3. Fill in the required fields with your information, including a valid email address, which will be used for future communications.
4. Read and accept the terms and conditions, then click "Create Account."
5. Check your email for a verification message from Rocky Linux and follow the instructions to activate your account.

A more detailed guide can be found [here](../../contributing/start.md).

## Step 2: Sign Contributor Agreement

As a new SIG member, you will need to sign the [Rocky Linux Contributor Agreement](../../contributing/rosca.md), which outlines the responsibilities and guidelines for contributors, as well as the [Rocky Git Contributor Agreement](@TODO NEED LINK), which describes the parameters within which the git services are to be used. The Rocky Git Contributor Agreement is required in order to be able to access git.rockylinux.org and/or git.resf.org.

1. Once logged into your RAS account, navigate to the "Agreements" section in your Profile.
2. Locate the "Rocky Contributor Agreement" and review the terms carefully.
3. Sign the agreement

## Step 3: Join the SIG

After setting up your RAS account and signing the necessary agreements, you're ready to officially join a SIG.

1. Visit the SIG section on the Rocky Linux website or directly access the [list of SIGs](../current.md) on the wiki .
2. Select the SIG you are interested in joining and review its mission, goals, and current projects.
3. Each SIG may have its specific onboarding steps, so look for any "Join Us" or "Get Involved" buttons.
4. If required, submit your information through the provided forms or contact the SIG leaders directly as instructed.

## Step 4: Request to Join the SIG and Attend the Initial Meeting

Now that you've identified the SIG you wish to join and are aware of its goals and projects, the next step is to formally request joining the SIG and attend the introductory meeting.

1. **Formal Request:** If not already done in the previous steps, ensure you submit a formal request to join the SIG. This should be through a ticket filed on the SIG’s space on https://git.resf.org/. In addition to any requirements and information requested by the SIG, you should mention your skills, interests, and how you plan to contribute to the SIG.

2. **Introduction Email / Message:** Prepare a brief introduction about yourself, your background, and your interest in the SIG. Send this introduction to the provided contact or post it in the SIG's dedicated communication channel if applicable. Every SIG has a dedicated channel in [Mattermost](https://chat.rockylinux.org/) where lots of planning and communications occur.

3. **Attend the Initial Meeting:** 
    - **Meeting Schedule:** Look for information on the SIG's meetings – dates, times, and how to join (e.g., video call link, physical location, etc.). This information is typically shared on the SIG's webpage, mailing list, or Rocky Linux's communication channels.
    - **Preparation:** Before the meeting, prepare a short introduction and a summary of what you hope to achieve within the SIG. This could include projects you're interested in, expertise you bring, or ideas for new initiatives.
    - **Participation:** During the meeting, take the opportunity to introduce yourself when welcomed to do so. Share your interests and how you wish to contribute. Be sure to listen actively to others and the ongoing projects or tasks discussed during the meeting.
   
Attending the initial meeting is a crucial step in integrating into the SIG. It allows you to meet other members, understand ongoing projects better, and find opportunities to contribute meaningfully. Active participation and engagement from the start will pave the way for a fruitful contribution to the Rocky Linux community through your chosen SIG. Welcome aboard, and we look forward to seeing you in the meeting!

## Step 5: Post-Membership Tasks

Your SIG leaders will [facilitate](onboarding_leads.md) the process of adding you to any necessary groups within the Rocky Linux ecosystem. This could include mailing lists, forum groups, or project teams.

1. Provide your RAS account information to your SIG leader if requested.
2. You'll receive invitations or confirmation messages for each group you’re added to. Follow any given instructions to complete your integration.
3. Check your email and your RAS dashboard regularly for updates or further instructions.
