Special Interest Groups are a core piece of the Rocky Linux community, in which
various members of these groups can extend the Enterprise Linux experience, by
way of packages, images, or other community engagement. Special Interest Groups
are typically smaller groups within the main community for the distribution,
with specific work on or awareness around a topic related to Rocky Linux and
potentially the Enterprise Linux Community as a whole.

This guide is for anyone in the Rocky community who are interested in starting,
managing, working on/contributing to a [Special Interest Group](../index.md).

Note that this guide is always evolving. Each guide page will have references
to the resources at the bottom of each page. The list of pages in this guide are
